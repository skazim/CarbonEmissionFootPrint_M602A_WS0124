# CarbonEmissionFootPrint_M602A_WS0124

## Abstract:
The carbon footprint as an essential indicator in environmental evaluation, which
measures the overall amount of greenhouse gas emissions linked to human activity
including deforestation, industry, and burning fossil fuels. It includes emissions from
industrial processes, waste management, energy use, and transportation and is
frequently expressed in carbon dioxide equivalents, or CO2e. In order to effectively
manage their environmental impact and combat climate change, individuals,
corporations, and nations must recognize and mitigate this footprint.

## Introduction:
A carbon footprint is a measurement of all the greenhouse gasses released into the
atmosphere as a result of human activity, including deforestation, industrial processes,
and the burning of fossil fuels for energy. Carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) are
commonly used to measure it. Transportation, energy use, waste disposal, and
industrial operations all contribute to emissions. It is a technique used by people,
organizations, and nations to comprehend, lessen, and deal with their environmental
impact and climate change.

## Problem Statement:
The global carbon footprint is growing despite growing awareness of the need to reduce
carbon emissions. This growth is primarily due to human activities including
deforestation, industrial operations, and the burning of fossil fuels. As a result, the
concentration of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is rising, which is causing
climate change and endangering the health and welfare of the world and its people.

## Solution:
A python based solution for measuring and managing carbon dioxide emissions can be
developed. For this, the below solutions are proposed, which cannot be considered as
whole, but to prevent carbon dioxide emissions to some extent. Following python based
solutions is proposed which consists:
- Data collection process is done via human inputs which covers some survey
questions including transportation, energy consumption in terms of electricity,
fuel, traveling, as well as waste management.
- After the survey is collected, the solution analyzes the consumption, calculates
the footprints, and identifies the key sources of emissions.
- To make it visual and help users to better understand their carbon dioxide
emissions.
- After analyzing, the solution suggests some recommendations to mitigate the
overall consumption and help reduce greenhouse effects.
